  IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM OLDER VERSION:
   1- Import the upgrade sql file(s) in /usr/local/IBSng/db
      corresponding to your version(Normally from_A1.04_upgrade.sql, from_A1.08_upgrade.sql
    				    from_A1.10_upgrade.sql, from_A1.12_upgrade.sql)

-- IBSng-alpha-2005-04-27
    Main Changes since last release are:
	-GnuGK update accounting handling
	    This workaround some problems with GnuGK keep stale users online
	    And Also make GnuGK more reliable

	-GnuGK Multiple login flag
	    This can be set via ras attributes. But GnuGK doesn't allow multiplt registration
	    from same account

	-Admin Deposit Change

	-Clear Functionality in online reports, for both VoIP and Internet Users.
	    Clear differs from kick in fact that clear only deletes user from online list
	    and doesn't deduct user credit usage. Kick tries to kick user from ras, and waits
	    for stop event to arrive normally.
	    The Clear icon isn't designed yet, and current icon is temporary.
	    
	-VoIP Charge Bug Fixes
	    Users with time limitaions in charge rule were able to continue call in 
	    Not-Defined times.

	-Fix a bug in showing float numbers (Thanks to Stoyko Neychev)

	-Fix multiple bugs in connection logs (Thanks to Stoyko Neychev)
