1. Downloading
    Latest version can be downloaded from http://ibs.sourceforge.net/

2. Extracting
    Extract the bz2 tarbal in /usr/local/. A sample Command can be

    $tar -xvjf IBSng-(VERSION NAME).tar.bz2 -C /usr/local

3. Change pg_hba.conf
    You should allow IBSng to connect postgresql database. It's done by changing pg_hba.conf
    normally located in /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf or /etc/postgrespg_hba.conf .
    
    For example, if database and ibs are on same box and you want to allow everyone on localhost to
    connect to IBSng database without password, put this line on *TOP* of pg_hba.conf.
    
    local  IBSng   ibs            trust
    
    You must restart postgresql service after changing pg_hba.conf.(ex. service postgresql restart)
    
    NOTE: if /var/lib/pgsql ( /var/lib/postgres on Debian ) directory is empty, 
	  try starting postgresql service, and it will initialize database.
