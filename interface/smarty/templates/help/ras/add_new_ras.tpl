You should register ras, to be able to cooperate with ibs.
Ras IP should be unique in active and not active rases. 
If ras is deactive you should reactive it instead of 
readding it.
Beware that you can't delete a ras after it's added. 
That's because there maybe reports and logs that reference 
to it. You should deactive ras instead of deleting ras.
